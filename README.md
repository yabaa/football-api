# football-api âš½

A football api which will be used in a personal project.
This api will simply expose for the moment, all team in all main soccer leagues.
And in a second time I will expose all planned games. 
This project will help me to upskill on front end technologies. 
I will develop a react app which will consume datas from this api. 
Why football? Because I'm a big fan âš½ ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· â˜…â˜… ï¸ŽðŸ˜€
